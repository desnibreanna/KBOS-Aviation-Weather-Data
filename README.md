# Aviation Weather Data Visualization and Analysis

This repository contains a student project focused on aviation weather patterns using real-world meteorological data. I downloaded, processed, and visualized weather datasets to identify important weather trends that impact flight safety and performance. This work was presented as a poster project for class at the Aviation Weather Showcase at the College of Aeronautics at Florida Institute of Technology.

## Project Goals

- Analyze aviation-related weather data (e.g., wind speed, visibility, cloud cover, temperature).
- Visualize the data using charts and graphs.
- Interpret the trends and patterns in the context of aviation meteorology.
- Present the results in a clear and educational format.
